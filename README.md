## Features

- **Easy assembly:** MorBot is designed to be easy to assemble based on the JetBot platform, with no soldering or complex wiring required. Children can follow the step-by-step instructions to assemble the robot themselves, which helps to develop their problem-solving and fine motor skills.
- **Programmable:** Once assembled, MorBot can be programmed using Integration with ROS for seamless control and interaction with the robot. The robot can be controlled using a variety of programming languages, including Python, C++ and Pre-built AI modules for Pupils to experiment with and customize.
- **Educational content:** MorBot comes with a series of lessons and challenges that are designed to teach children about STEM concepts such as robotics, engineering, and coding. The lessons are presented in a fun and engaging way, with videos, animations, and interactive exercises that help to reinforce the concepts.
- **Expandable:** MorBot is designed to be expandable, with a range of accessories and add-ons that can be used to enhance the robot's capabilities. Children can use these accessories to create custom projects and experiments, which helps to foster creativity and innovation.

## Main Components

- **JetBot:** - The JetBot, an easily assembled robot, utilizes the Jetson Nano, a compact yet powerful computer. Its user-friendly nature and capability to perform complex tasks, like running AI algorithms and managing robot movements, make it an ideal choice.

- **Jetson Nano:** - The Jetson Nano, as the "brain" of the robot, processes information and controls its movements. This compact, powerful computer efficiently runs AI algorithms and manages energy well, ensuring long operation times on a single battery charge.

Understanding Linux and Python is crucial in robotics and ROS because Linux provides a robust and versatile OS ideal for the complex, concurrent tasks in robotics, while Python, due to its simplicity and vast library support, is widely used for scripting and implementing algorithms in ROS.
