# MorBot - Educational Robot Platform for Kids

MorBot is an exciting educational robot platform designed for kids to learn about robotics, deep neural networks (DNN), machine learning (ML), and programming using the Robot Operating System (ROS). This interactive and fun platform offers hands-on experience for kids to explore the fascinating world of robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) in an engaging and easy-to-understand way.

## Features

- **Easy assembly:** MorBot is designed to be easy to assemble based on the JetBot platform , with no soldering or complex wiring required. Children can follow the step-by-step instructions to assemble the robot themselves, which helps to develop their problem-solving and fine motor skills.
- **Programmable:** Once assembled, MorBot can be programmed using Integration with ROS for seamless control and interaction with the robot. The robot can be controlled using a variety of programming languages, including Python, C++ and Pre-built AI modules for kids to experiment with and customize .
- **Educational content:** MorBot comes with a series of lessons and challenges that are designed to teach children about STEM concepts such as robotics, engineering, and coding. The lessons are presented in a fun and engaging way, with videos, animations, and interactive exercises that help to reinforce the concepts.
- **Expandable:** MorBot is designed to be expandable, with a range of accessories and add-ons that can be used to enhance the robot's capabilities. Children can use these accessories to create custom projects and experiments, which helps to foster creativity and innovation.

## Prerequisites

- **Jetson Nano:** - The Jetson Nano is a small computer that is used to control the robot. It is the "brain" of the robot, and it is responsible for processing information and controlling the robot's movements. The Jetson Nano is a powerful computer that can perform complex tasks, such as running artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and controlling the robot's movements. It is also very energy efficient, which means that it can run for a long time on a single battery charge. The Jetson Nano is a great choice for a robot because it is small, powerful, and energy efficient.
