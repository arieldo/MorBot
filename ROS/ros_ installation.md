# Installing ROS Melodic on Ubuntu 18.04

This guide will walk you through the installation process of ROS Melodic on Ubuntu 18.04. ROS (Robot Operating System) is a popular framework for building robotic software, providing tools and libraries for developing, simulating, and deploying robotic applications.

## Prerequisites

Before installing ROS Melodic, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic Beaver) installed and updated with the latest packages.
- A working internet connection to download and install ROS packages.

## Installation Steps

Follow these steps to install ROS Melodic on Ubuntu 18.04:

1. Configure your Ubuntu system to accept software from packages.ros.org. First, add the ROS repository to your system's list of package sources:

    ```
    $ sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu bionic main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
    ```

2. Next, add the ROS public key to your system:

    ```
    $ curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.asc | sudo apt-key add -
    ```

3. Update your system's package index and install the ROS desktop-full package:

    ```
    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-desktop-full
    ```

4. Initialize rosdep, a tool for installing system dependencies required by ROS packages:

    ```
    $ sudo rosdep init
    $ rosdep update
    ```

5. Set up your environment variables to use ROS. Add the following lines to your .bashrc file:

    ```
    $ echo "source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
    $ source ~/.bashrc
    ```

6. Verify that ROS has been installed correctly by running the following command:

    ```
    $ roscore
    ```

    This should start the ROS master and display a message indicating that it is running.

Congratulations, you have successfully installed ROS Melodic on Ubuntu 18.04! You can now start developing and running ROS applications on your system.
