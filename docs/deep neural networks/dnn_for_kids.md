#what are deep neural networks?

Deep neural networks are like super smart detectives that can figure out all sorts of things by looking at pictures or listening to sounds. They're a special type of computer brain power that helps computers understand and learn things just like we do, but they're especially good at finding patterns and solving puzzles.

Imagine you have a giant box of differently shaped and colored LEGOs, and you want to sort them by color and shape. It might take you a while to figure out how to do it, but eventually, you'll learn and become faster at sorting them. Deep neural networks work in a similar way!

Here's how deep neural networks do their detective work:

1. **Learning from examples:** Just like you learn from watching and doing, deep neural networks learn from lots of examples. The more pictures or sounds they see or hear, the better they become at understanding and finding patterns.

2. **Making decisions:** Once a deep neural network has learned from many examples, it can make decisions based on what it has learned. For example, it could tell you if a picture is of a cat or a dog, or if a sound is someone laughing or crying.

3. **Learning from mistakes:** Just like you learn from your mistakes, deep neural networks learn from their mistakes too. If they make a mistake, they can go back and learn from the examples again, so they can make better decisions next time.

4. **Solving puzzles:** Deep neural networks can also solve puzzles by looking at pictures or listening to sounds. For example, they can tell you what's in a picture, or what someone is saying.

5. **Self-driving cars:** They help cars see the road, recognize traffic signs, and avoid accidents.

6. **Voice assistants:** They help voice assistants like Siri or Alexa understand what you're saying and give you the right answers.

7. **Video games:** They can make video games more realistic and fun by making the characters and objects in the game behave more like real life.

So, deep neural networks are like super smart computer detectives that can learn from examples and make decisions based on what they've learned. They're used in many fun and helpful ways, making our lives easier and more exciting!

## For example, MorBot can use deep neural networks to:

1. **Find objects:** MorBot can use deep neural networks to find a specific toy in a room, just like you might look for your favorite toy when it's time to play.

2. **follow you:** MorBot can use deep neural networks to follow you around the room, just like you might follow your friend when you're playing a game.

3. **Read signs:** MorBot can use deep neural networks to read traffic signs, so it knows when to stop or what speed to go, just like how you read signs while riding a bike or walking.
